# Word-Guess-Game

This project contains a Hangman word guessing game. It is based on cartoons of the 1980s and shows pictures of the cartoons as hints. This pages was designed using Bootstrap and are responsive.

Overview
1. Key events used to listen for the letters that players will type.

2. The following are displayed on the page:
   1. Wins
   2. Current Word
   3. Number of guesses remaining
   4. Letters already guessed

3. User is prompted "Press any key to get started!" to start game.

4. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

   * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

5. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

6. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

7. After the user wins/loses the game prompts the user "Press any key to get started!" then automatically chooses another word and makes the user play it.
